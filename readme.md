# Usage
Quickstart
- Compiled Executable

Download the executable binary file, and run it directly or from the terminal (Windows and Linux)

```
chmod +x saavn-cli
./saavn-cli search english songs
```
This will query the API for "english songs" and then display the results as a list. Enter comma-seperated numbers of tracks to download (eg. 4,6,12,15)

- Python Script (Lighter)

Universal :
```
python saavn-cli.py search english songs
```

# How it works ?

>When a user runs the script to search or download songs,<br> The script requests download links, album art, album details, etc from the unofficial API. It downloads the raw files and then compiles them using ffmpeg.

# Installation
### Requirements

- ffmpeg
- Python (v3)

1) Install FFMPEG
<br>To check if ffmpeg is properly installed, run<br>
`ffmpeg -version`<br>
[Download ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)<br>
- Termius/Linux : `sudo apt install ffmpeg`<br>
- MacOS (Homebrew) : `brew install ffmpeg` <br> check [brew.sh](https://brew.sh) <br>
- Windows users can copy `ffmpeg.exe` to `C:\Windows\System32` or any other `$PATH` Directory

2) Download Executable from [RELEASES PAGE](https://github.com/wiz64/saavn-cli/releases/)
Directly run commands relatively to the executables. (Windows and Linux)
